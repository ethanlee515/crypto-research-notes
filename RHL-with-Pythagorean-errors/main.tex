\begin{abstract}
    We propose \emph{Relational Hoare Logic with Pythagorean Errors} as a way to apply the \emph{Pythagorean probability preservation} property to pairs of probabilistic programs.
    This is possibly \emph{not} enough material to be a paper draft in and of itself.
    More likely however, this will become part of a larger paper.

\section{Introduction}

In program analysis, we often compare pairs of programs.
For example, often we aim to prove

The work \cite{kl-queries} proposes the use of KL-divergence in the context of...
The lemma has since been generalized by the work \cite{mw17} and coined \emph{Pythagorean probability preservation}.

The main application of our program logic is the analysis of the CKKS homomorphic encryption scheme.
\Ethan{TODO this has to be more useful than just CKKS.}
